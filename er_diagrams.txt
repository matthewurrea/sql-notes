Enity Relationship Diagram
(for this example we are using a school)


Entity - An object we want to model and store information about.

Entity1 - STUDENT

Attributes - A specific pieces of information about an entity.

STUDENT.NAME
STUDENT.GRADE#
STUDENT.GPA

Primary Key - An attribute(s) that uniquely identify an entry in the database table.

STUDENT.ID 

Composite Attribute - An attribute that can be broken up into sub-attributes.

STUDENT.NAME.FirstNAME/LastNAME

Multi-valued Attribute - An attribute that can have more than one value.

STUDENT.clubs (two circle circle)

Derived Attribute - An attribute that can be derived from the other attributes.

STUDENT.has_honors

Multiple Entites - You can define more than one entity in the diagram.

CLASS.CLASS_ID

Relationships - defines a relationship between two entities 

(STUDENT) partial participation (takes) total participation (CLASS)

single line = partial participation
double line = total participation 

Total Participation - All members must participate in the relationship.

Relationship Attribute - An attribute about the relationship. 

Takes.grade

Relationship Cardinality - the number of instances of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation. 

1:1
1:N 
N:M

STUDENT N Takes M CLASS 

Weak Enity - An entity that cannot be uniquely indentified by its attributes alone. 

Identifying relationship - A relationship that serves to uniquly identify the weak entity. 

CLASS has EXAM.exam_id
(CLASS) partial participation (HAS) total participation (EXAM)

(EXAM cannot exist without a CLASS)
(just as CLASS cannot exist without a STUDENT)

Converting ERD to a Schema

Step 1: Mapping of Regular Enitity Types
For each regular entity type create a relation (table) that includes all the simple attributes of that entity. 
Composite attributes are related by each sub attribute in the table. 

Step 2: Mapping of Weak Enity Types
For each weak entity type create a relation (table) that includes all simple attributes of the weak entity. 
The primary key of the new relation should be the partial key of the weak enitiy plus the primary key of its owner. 

Step 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship Types
Include one side of the relationship as a foreign key, in the other Favor total participation.

Step 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types
Include the 1 side's primary key as a foreign key on the N side relation(table)

Step 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types
Create a new relation (table) who's primary key is a combination of both entites' primary key's. Also include any relationship attributes.
